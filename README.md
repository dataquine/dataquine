# Lesley Duff aka Data Quine

A career changer. I was 4 weeks into a 14 week course retraining with the [@CodeClan](https://github.com/codeclan) [Professional Data Analysis](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-analysis/) DR22 remote cohort when CodeClan sadly went into liquidation.
So I have a beginner level of R with data wrangling and cleaning but no certificate to show for it. And have lost a considerable amount of money in the process. The instructors were brilliant. Intense course, hard work and long hours but was really enjoying it. Was looking forward to future modules on visualisation and machine learning. CodeClan gave students access to the course materials we would have received so Ill carry on self-learning from their content in the short term.

## What I want, what I really, *really* want. "I want" doesn't get, so pretty please üôè

Currently unemployed due to cuts in government funding of charities and looking for work either in #Glasgow or preferably remote. #Disabled and have found working from home since #COVID-19 tremendously enabling as it reduces some barriers for me.

***Ideally*** meaningful work that tackles inequality and/or improves the lives of people in #Scotland. 
Previously I've worked in #Education, #SocialWork and #SocialCare sectors, all have been incredibly rewarding in ways other than money.

Open minded as to role e.g. #DataAnalyst, #DataScientist or #DataEngineer whatever else as a label but deluged with data. Current skills more at the engineering end but I'm doing my best to learn what I can of the other disciplines and will continue to find out about whatever is necessary to do the job at hand. I practice what I preach regarding lifelong learning - self-funded on this course so I put my money where my mouth is.

## What are my super powers? ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. Finding things out.
2. Connecting people with information and each other.  
3. People keep telling me I'm *"patient"* and *"good at explaining technical things to non-technical people"*.
4. Automating drudgery and repetitive tasks. Let the machines do the donkey work, save the humans for the intelligence bit.
5. Solving problems and putting solutions in place to help prevent difficulties in the future.

## In case you were wondering

'Quine' means woman or girl in Doric - a variety of Scots spoken in the North-East of Scotland.

PS It's "Data Quine" not "Date a Quine". *Quite*, ***quite*** different.
