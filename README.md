# Lesley Duff aka Data Quine
## Who I am
Scottish senior web and software developer now testing whether the third act of my professional life is working with data.
A career changer about to retrain in data analytics with the @CodeClan [Professional Data Analysis DR22 cohort](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-analysis/).

## What I want. "I want" doesn't get, so pretty please
Currently unemployed and looking for work from November 2023 onwards either in #Glasgow or preferably remote. 

*Ideally* something meaningful that tackles inequality and improves the lives of people in Scotland.

Open minded as to role e.g.: #DataAnalytics, #DataScience or #DataEngineer.

## In case you were wondering
Quine means woman or girl in Doric - a variety of Scots spoken in the North-East of Scotland.
