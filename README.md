# Lesley Duff aka Data Quine
## Who am I? 🙋🏻‍♀️

Scottish senior web and software developer now exploring whether the third act of my professional life is working with data.

A career changer about to retrain with the [@CodeClan](https://github.com/codeclan) [Professional Data Analysis](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-analysis/) DR22 cohort.

## What I want, what I really, *really* want. "I want" doesn't get, so pretty please 🙏

Currently unemployed and looking for work after the course from around November 2023 onwards either in #Glasgow or preferably remote. #Disabled and have found working from home since #COVID-19 tremendously enabling as it reduces some barriers for me.

***Ideally*** meaningful work that tackles inequality and/or improves the lives of people in #Scotland. 
Previously I've worked in the #Education, #SocialWork and #SocialCare sectors, all have been incredibly rewarding in ways other than money.

Open minded as to role e.g. #DataAnalyst, #DataScientist or #DataEngineer whatever else as a label but deluged with data. Current skills more at the engineering end but I'm doing my best to learn what I can of the other disciplines and will continue to find out about whatever is necessary to do the job at hand. I practice what I preach regarding lifelong learning - self-funded on this course so I put my money where my little old lady mouth is.

## What are my super powers? 🦸🏻‍♀️

1. Finding things out.
2. Connecting people with information.  
3. People keep telling me I'm *"patient"* and *"good at explaining technical things to non-technical people"*.
4. Automating repetitive tasks. Let the machines do those, let the humans do the intelligence bit.
5. Solving problems and putting solutions in place to help prevent difficulties in the future.

## In case you were wondering

Quine means woman or girl in Doric - a variety of Scots spoken in the North-East of Scotland.
